Please check out the [proposed agenda](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/wiki-proposed-agenda-for-the-council-of-berlin-set-for-july-14-15/377) wiki on the EthMagicians forum.

We are making a "Call for Lightning EIP Talks". We want to provide space where people can live present their EIP, either as needed for discussion by all of the Magicians or by focused Working Groups. The format will be 3 slides and a 5 minute presentation, with a brief 5 minute Q&A session. These presentations will be livestreamed and recorded, and will help determine what gets discussed. Please [add your Lightning EIP Talk to the wiki](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/wiki-proposed-agenda-for-the-council-of-berlin-set-for-july-14-15/377).
