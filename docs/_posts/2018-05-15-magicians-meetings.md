We've heard you loud and clear! [The word "council" has been raising some eyebrows](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/the-term-council-may-be-easily-misunderstood-by-ourselves-and-the-community/357) as it sounds exclusive and not welcoming.

We're evolving everything about this process out in the open, so please do participate and we'll figure it out together.

For now -- other than the repo name! -- we think we're going to consistently call these Magicians Meetings, with this being the Summer Meeting. The Spring Meeting was at EthCC in Paris, and the Fall Meeting will be around Devcon.

We are also confirming that the dates will be **July 14th & 15th**, and the venue will be [c-base](https://c-base.org/).

Please do let us know if you'll join us -- or any other comments -- by [filling out the Expression of Interest form](https://goo.gl/forms/xTYJHOV2R6FQfN4m2).
